## Curbing Pharma Influence: The Effect of Marketing Restrictions on Physicians' Prescribing Behavior and Healthcare Expenditure

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>Abstract</strong>
</p>

The impact of direct-to-physician marketing and its regulations on physicians' prescribing behavior is a subject of ongoing debate. While the pharmaceutical industry advocates for the necessity of keeping doctors informed about new drugs through these channels, critics voice concerns about potential distortions in prescribing patterns. To address the possible adverse effects of these interactions, New Jersey implemented a policy in January 2018 imposing significant restrictions on direct-to-physician marketing, including limits on small meal payments and caps on substantial payments for consulting and speaking. Using the New Jersey policy as an exogenous source of variation and two federal administrative databases in a difference-in-difference event-study design, I estimate a reduction of about 27% in marketing activities directed at New Jersey doctors compared to their peers in New York and Pennsylvania. Reduced form analyses reveal that prescribers in New Jersey decrease the prescription volume of marketed drugs by approximately 6% across extensive and intensive margins. Moreover, the overall proportion of branded prescriptions decreases by about 0.66 percentage points. The predominant source of the observed behavioral changes originates from prescribers with high level of exposure to pharmaceutical promotions, with no significant change among those with limited or without such engagement. The policy equally affected both new and old drug prescriptions, suggesting that doctor-pharma financial ties may not be purely informational.
