I am a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Microeconomics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, with research interests at the intersection of health and public economics. My current work employs causal inference techniques and large datasets to examine how state and federal policies influence physician prescribing practices, patient health outcomes, and overall healthcare expenditures. By generating evidence-based insights, I aim to inform the development of more effective and equitable health and economic policies, ultimately contributing to improved healthcare delivery and resource allocation.

I am on the 2024-2025 economics job market, and will be available for interviews.
