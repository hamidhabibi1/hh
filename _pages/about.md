I am a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Microeconomics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, with research interests at the intersection of health and public economics. My research leverages causal inference designs and large datasets to explore how state and federal policies influence physician prescribing practices, patient health outcomes, and healthcare system expenditures. By generating evidence-based insights, I aim to inform the design of more effective and equitable public and economic policies, ultimately contributing to improved healthcare delivery and resource allocation.

I am on the 2024-2025 economics job market, and will be available for interviews.
