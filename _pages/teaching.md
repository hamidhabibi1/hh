  <h1><strong>Teaching Philosophy</strong></h1>
</div>

---

I strongly believe that teaching should inspire curiosity and critical thinking, rather than simply transfer knowledge. I aim to create a dynamic, student-centered environment where students actively engage with economic concepts through a blend of lectures, discussions, and practical applications. My teaching follows the Teacher-Scholar Model, which combines teaching and research in a way that enhances both. Research brings fresh insights into the classroom, making teaching more relevant and current, while teaching stimulates new ideas and questions that can lead to further research. Economics is inherently abstract, so simplifying complex issues is vital for effective teaching. I bring passion to the subject by posing relevant questions and incorporating real-world scenarios that resonate with studentsâ€™ experiences. This not only deepens engagement but also improves learning outcomes by helping students connect theory to practice and develop critical analytical skills.

## Primary Instructor

<p style="margin-top: 20px;">
</p>

**Econ 104: Is there Truth in Numbers? The Role of Statistics in Economics (Causal Inference)**

University of California, Santa Cruz  

## Course Description

This is the main upper-division course in Applied Microeconomics. In this course, students develop the art of empirical analysis where they use real economic data in an interactive way. I taught experimental and quasi-experimental methods, including Randomized Control Trials, Instrumental Variables, Propensity Score Matching, Difference-in-Differences, and Regression Discontinuity design. In addition, I provided extensive training for the students in writing codes and translating their results into 2 full-length academic manuscripts.  

## Quarters Taught 

Spring 2024, Summer 2023, and Summer 2022
