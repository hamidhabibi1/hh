## **Primary Instructor**


**Econ 104: Is there Truth in Numbers? The Role of Statistics in Economics (Causal Inference)**
University of California, Santa Cruz  

## Course Description

This is the main upper-division course in Causal Inference. In this course, students develop the art of empirical analysis where they use real economic data in an interactive way. I taught experimental and quasi-experimental methods, including Randomized Control Trials, Instrumental Variables, Propensity Score Matching, Difference-in-Differences, and Regression Discontinuity design. In addition, I provided extensive training for the students in writing codes and translating their results into 2 full-length academic manuscripts.
