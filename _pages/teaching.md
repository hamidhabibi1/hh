  <h1><strong>Teaching Philosophy</strong></h1>
</div>

---

I strongly believe teaching should inspire curiosity and critical thinking, not just transfer knowledge. I aim to create a dynamic environment where students actively engage with economic concepts through lectures, discussions, and practical applications. Grounded in the Teacher-Scholar Model, my teaching integrates research to foster continuous learning and innovation. Economics is inherently abstract, so simplifying complex issues is vital for effective teaching. I bring passion to the subject by posing relevant questions and incorporating real-world scenarios that resonate with studentsâ€™ experiences. This not only deepens engagement but also improves learning outcomes by helping students connect theory to practice and develop critical analytical skills.

## Primary Instructor

<p style="margin-top: 20px;">
</p>

**Econ 104: Is there Truth in Numbers? The Role of Statistics in Economics (Causal Inference)**

University of California, Santa Cruz  

## Course Description

This is the main upper-division course in Causal Inference. In this course, students develop the art of empirical analysis where they use real economic data in an interactive way. I taught experimental and quasi-experimental methods, including Randomized Control Trials, Instrumental Variables, Propensity Score Matching, Difference-in-Differences, and Regression Discontinuity design. In addition, I provided extensive training for the students in writing codes and translating their results into 2 full-length academic manuscripts.
